# Teaching-case notes (repo-level)

This repo is designed so each competition year can be taught as a short applied ML case.

Recommended teaching pattern per year:
1) Explain the task + evaluation metric
2) Establish a strong, simple baseline
3) Add one “modern” approach for contrast
4) Compare outcomes using the *competition metric*
5) Diagnose why one method wins (data size, text length, inductive bias, leakage risk)

Instructor notes per year should include:
- learning objectives
- typical failure modes
- discussion questions
- extensions for students
